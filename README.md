📁 Dual Access Control for Cloud-Based Data Storage and Sharing
A Java-based web application that implements a Dual Access Control Mechanism to enhance the security, integrity, and efficiency of cloud-based data storage and sharing systems. This system leverages cryptographic techniques and machine learning to prevent unauthorized access and optimize resource usage.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Java (JSP, Servlets)

Database: MySQL (managed using SQLYog)

Server: Apache Tomcat 6.0

IDE: Eclipse Oxygen

Connectivity: JDBC


📌 Key Features

🔒 Dual Access Control: Combines attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) with secure download handling.

🧠 Machine Learning Integration: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) used to monitor and manage download patterns.

🔐 Cryptography: SHA, AES, and CP-ABE for layered security.


📁 Role-Based Architecture:

Data Owner

Authority


Cloud Server

End User



📦 Installation Instructions

1.Clone the Repository :

git clone https://github.com/your-username/dual-access-control-cloud.git

2.Set up MySQL Database

Use SQLYog or MySQL CLI to create the database.

mport the provided .sql file (if available).

3.Configure JDBC

Edit DBConnection.java with your MySQL credentials.

4.Deploy to Apache Tomcat
